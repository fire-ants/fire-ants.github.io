<span style="font-family: Roboto Mono Bold Italic for Powerline;"><big><big style="font-weight: bold;">So what is Hitter Value (HVal)?</big><br style="font-weight: bold;"></big><br><span style="font-family: Roboto Mono Light for Powerline;">Hitter Value (HVal) is an analytics algorithm developed by the Fire Ants.&nbsp; This  algorithm uses a combination of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Qualitiative</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quantitative </span>scores to assign a value per pitch.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quantititave Scores</span> are based on the typical outcomes of a pitch, using <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">1.0</span> as for on-base and <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-weight: bold;">-1.0</span> for an out. For example, Strikes are <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">-.0333</span>, Balls are <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">0.025</span> and so forth.&nbsp; <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Qualitative Scores</span> are based on text processing from the offical scorer's statement about the pitch and At Bat event. For example, balls put into play with key words such as "<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">sharply</span>" or "<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">liner</span>" are scored more heavily towards the batter's benefit.&nbsp; Conversely, when the scorer describes balls in play as "<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">softly</span>", "<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">pops</span>", or "<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">flies</span>", then these are scored more in favor of the pitcher.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hitter Value</span> is a sum of these <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quantitative</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Qualitative</span> scores.&nbsp; HVal = QualScore + QuantScore.<br><br></span></span><img style="width: 210px; height: 108px;" src="images/fire-ants.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
